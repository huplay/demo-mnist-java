# Demo MNIST application

This is a feed forward neural network demo application for handwritten digit recognition on MNIST database.

The main goal was to implement the backpropagation algorithm in the simplest way.

Source of the MNIST database:

I removed the header and split the training data into three files to avoid the GitHub upload limit.
